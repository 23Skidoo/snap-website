          <h2>What is Snap Framework?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Snap Framework</strong> is a simple web development framework similar to <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> or <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on
              Rails</a> but with the power of the purely functional language, Haskell behind it.  Snap stands on the
            shoulders of another exciting Haskell project
            known as <a href="http://happstack.com/">Happstack</a>.  While Happstack
            is a great project with some interesting goals I found it lacks
            many features web developers expect from a web framework.
            Snap brings together Happstack with features such as
            templates and relational database interfaces so
            that real world web developers who want to use Haskell can get the job
            done faster.

          <h2>Why Haskell?</h2>
          <p>
            <img class="left-img" src="/img/haskell.png" />
            <strong><a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a></strong> is a full featured language with a powerful compiler (<a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>)
            behind it and possibly even more important one of the best
            communities of any language in use today.</p>
          <p>
            Many people see Haskell as a difficult language to understand and
            program in but this reputation is simply not accurate. 
            When I first started developing my own site in
            Haskell it was purely for the novelty of trying a new language
            out.  After some time though, not only did I enjoy doing web
            development in Haskell I found it to be monumentally easier then it
            would have been in a conventional language like Python or Perl.  
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>I don't know Haskell and I fear it.</h2>
          <p><strong>No problem</strong> we all start out young and afraid, I highly reccomend
            starting out with <i><a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a
                Haskell for Great Good</a></i> then following up with
            some <i><a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/">Real World
                Haskell</a></i>. They are both free and very readable, so you have no excuse
            not to learn Haskell.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
          <h2>What goals does Snap have?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Snap</strong> has the following goals in mind:
            <ul>
              <li>Rapid Development.</li>
              <li>Safer Development.</li>
              <li>Development that lends itself toward collaboration with non
                (Haskell) programmers.</li>
              <li>Sites that are scalable.</li>
              <li>Site that are easy and enjoyable to maintain.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Where is the project at?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Snap</strong> is still in the earliest stages of
            development.  Much is still being planned and the foundations of the
            project are still very much in the works.  Release the source code
            at this early point would likely be counter productive but I
            expect to have a first release of the code within the coming
            months.  Snap will of course be an open source project in the
            future, so I hope anyone interested in lending a hand in development
            will keep this site bookmarked.
