Snap Website

This is the source code for http://snapframework.com/.

Building
--------

If you wish to work on the Snap website yourself, you will also need to install
http://github.com/snapframework/snap-static-pages by hand first. This can be
done by cloning that repository, and then running `cabal install`. After that,
you can build a development server by running `cabal configure` and `cabal
build`.
